	arena
		fallen after -1
		from -1 to 63
		25,25 is player spawn (center)
		full arena can crash (pos 0,0?)
		tile 0,1 invisible?
		lower than -1 no tile (or death)
		-1000 default void
		0 normal height
		tiny differences
		player spawns on top of a tile (doesnt get stuck but game will probably crash/do odd stuff)
