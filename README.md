## Credits
While I've built this application myself, I'd like to thank everyone that has put effort into figuring out how the survival file actually works.
[This thread](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=797571917) posted by ThePassiveDada has helped me a lot, as well as [these two editors](https://steamcommunity.com/app/422970/discussions/0/1483232961033779525/) created by bowsr and Sojk.
