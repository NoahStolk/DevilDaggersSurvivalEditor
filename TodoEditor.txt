    warning
        spawnsets with modified arenas are likely to crash the game
            full arena crashes when you go to tile 0,0 (i think)
            spawning the player on a higher tile might crash the game (needs more research)
            high tiles make the game potentially unstable and might crash
    basics
        arena
            arena size is 50x50
            tile 25,25 is player spawn (center)
            0 normal height
            -1 and below is fallen height
            tile 0,1 is invisible for some reason but you can still walk on it
            default arena in the game has tiny differences in tile heights
            you can make the player spawn on a higher tile (though not recommended because enemies will go through the floor, the game might crash, etc)
    gui
        arena
            editor supports from -1 to 63, under -1 is void (no difference in the game even though it supports it)
            editor default void is -1000
